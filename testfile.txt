Whispers of the Wind

In the hushed silence of the dawn,

The whispers of the wind softly spawn.

Through the rustling leaves, the secrets unfold,

In the tale of the wind, a story is told.

A hushed sonnet, in the heart of the tree,

The windâ€™s sweet ballad, a melody free.

In the dance of the leaves, in the wind's soft sigh,

In the whispers of the wind, the secrets never die.
